# 150 Seconds

A lot can happen in two and a half minutes - especially if you're playing 150 Seconds.

150 Seconds is a two-player game which revolves around a chess clock. Players will take turns completing the prompted tasks, and then press the space bar when the task is finished.

A task can be skipped if needed, at the expense of a 30-second penalty.

The player whose time runs out first loses.


# Requirements

A portion of the tasks are based on the default applications installed on iOS phones.
